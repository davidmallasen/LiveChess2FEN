# Contributing to LiveChess2FEN

First of all, thank you for reading these lines and taking the time to
 contribute! We are open to new issues and contributions of any kind.
 
## How Can I Contribute?

#### **Did you find a bug or intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Please check the 
[Issues](https://github.com/davidmallasen/LiveChess2FEN/issues) tab first
to avoid duplicates.

- If there is no open issue addressing the situation, feel free to
[open a new one](https://github.com/davidmallasen/LiveChess2FEN/issues/new)!
Be sure to include a **title and clear description** and as much relevant 
information as possible. 

#### **Do you want to write some piece of code or any other contribution?**

- If you haven't done it already, fork the repository and create a new
 branch with a descriptive name.

- Write and commit the changes to the repo in the new branch. Please be sure
 to check the [styleguides](#style-guides) below.

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch!

- Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the thought behind
 the contribution. Include the relevant issue number if there is one open.

## Style guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests when needed ("Fix #123").

### Python style guide

- Please follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guide
 in order to keep the code consistent. When in doubt, check nearby code.
  
    - We recommend using VS Code's [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) extension.
