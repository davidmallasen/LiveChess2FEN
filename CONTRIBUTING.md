## How Can I Contribute?

#### **Did you find a bug or intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Please check the 
[Issues](https://github.com/davidmallasen/LiveChess2FEN/issues) tab first

[open a new one](https://github.com/davidmallasen/LiveChess2FEN/issues/new)!
Be sure to include a **title and clear description** and as much relevant 
information as possible. 

#### **Do you want to write some piece of code or any other contribution?**

- If you haven't done it already, fork the repository and create a new
 branch with a descriptive name.

- Write and commit the changes to the repo in the new branch. Please be sure
 to check the [styleguides](#style-guides) below.

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch!

- Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the thought behind
 the contribution. Include the relevant issue number if there is one open.
